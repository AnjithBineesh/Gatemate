# GATEMATE üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TECHTONICS


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Elda Rosy Pinheiro - SNM Institute Of Management and Technology
- Member 2: Anugraha Sunil - SNM Institute Of Management and Technology
- Member 3: Anjith Bineesh -SNM Institute Of Management and Technology

### Project Description
The automatic smart gate system uses an Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor to enable automated gate opening and closing. When the ultrasonic sensor detects an approaching object, the servo motor rotates to operate the gate¬†accordingly

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Manual gate operation in residential, commercial, or secured areas can be inefficient, leading to delays and requiring constant human effort. Unattended gates also pose security risks, as they may be left open accidentally. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project aims to develop an automatic smart gate system using an Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor to detect objects and automatically operate the gate, providing a convenient and secure solution for controlled¬†access
